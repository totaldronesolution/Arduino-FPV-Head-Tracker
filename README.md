This project is made as user-friendly as possible while maintaining flexibility for developers and tinkerers. Only a little technical knowledge should be necessary. All necessary settings can be changed from a graphical user interface, making it easy for everyone to use. 

A quick test-video can be found here. It's hard to show if a headtracker works well or not, so it's just a quick test-video.https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3947315/Videogdp.3gp
